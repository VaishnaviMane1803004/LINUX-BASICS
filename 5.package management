Introduction:
-Package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on the system.
* yum :- It adds the functionality of automatic updates and package management with dependency management to RPM-based systems.
-It enables: -> RPM metadata calculation for RPMs hosted in Artifactory local repositories.
            -> Provisioning RPMs directly from Artifactory to YUM clients.
            -> Enables high concurrency performance for the software development industry   
            -> Detailed RPM metadata views from Artifactory's web UI.
            -> Providing GPG signatures that can be used by the YUM client to authenticate RPM metadata.
-The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d & File must have an extension .repo.
Difference between apt & yum is ubantu has .deb extension which is from different family but cendos ,fedora,dell has .rpm extension which is from same family.

=>Command Purpose:
yum install:Installs the specified packages:- yum install PACKAGENAME
remove:	Removes the specified packages: -yum remove PACKAGENAME
info:Lists description:-yum info PACKAGENAME
update:Updates each package to the latest version:-yum update
history	:Displays what has happened in past transactions :-yum history 
history undo:To reverse a transaction :-yum history undo INDEXNUMBER

* RPM :- It is the package management system used by Linux Standard Base (LSB)-compliant distributions for low-level handling of packages. 
Just like dpkg, it can query, install, verify, upgrade, and remove packages, and is more frequently used by Fedora-based distributions, such as RHEL and CentOS.
-RPM is a popular package management tool in Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based distros. Using RPM, you can install, uninstall, and query individual software packages. Still, it cannot manage dependency resolution like YUM. RPM does provide you useful output, including a list of required packages. An RPM package consists of an archive of files and metadata. Metadata includes helper scripts, file attributes, and information about packages.
-RPM maintains a database of installed packages, which enables powerful and fast queries. 
-The RPM database is inside /var/lib, and the file is named __db*.

=> RPM commands :
- To install an rpm from the file :- rpm -ivh filename.rpm
- To list the name of all packages currently installed :- rpm --query --all or rpm -qa - 
- To generates a list of files installed by a given package :- rpm -ql
- To remove the given package :- rpm --erase package-name(s) or rpm -e
