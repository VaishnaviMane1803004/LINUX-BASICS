*Introduction :
- The process of dividing a disk into logical areas that can be worked with separately is called partitioning.
-For easy backup procedure,for many os on a single disk,for having different partition for different file systems ,more management of disk memory ,etc.
 for this  we use partitioning.

*Types of chips for motherboard:
1.BIOS:
-Master Boot Record (MBR) method is used which have MSDOS as labels for BIOS.
-Hardisk size 2 Tb & metadata stored from start to end partition.
-Can do only 4 primary partition for booting process files.
-It has firmware support as BIOS.
2.UEFI:
-GUID Partition Table (GPT) method is used For UFI.
-Hardisk size 10 Tb .
-The storage is divided into two parts known as Primary Partition & Extended Partition.
-Primary partition has booting file & extended partion has storage files for the data to store.
-In GPT, it is possible to create primary & extended but after creating extended you can not create primary.
-Can do 64 partition & GPT have backend
-It has firmware support as UEFI.

*Two kinds of major partitions on a Linux system:
1.data partition: Data in Linux system including the root partition containing all the data to start up and run the system; 
2.swap partition: extra memory /expansion of the computer's physical memory, 

*Steps to create a partition :

1. List partitions=> Parted -l
2. Label a partition=> parted / dev /vdb mklabel msdos => parted -l 
3. Use mkpart to make a partition=> parted /dev /vdb => mkpart=> primary=> xfs=> 2048s=> x%=> p
4. Let the partition be created/settled=>quit first then=> Udevam settle
5. Attach the file system to the partition=> mkfs. xFs /dev/vdbl
6. Create a mount point directory=> df-h => mkdir / archive
7. Add entry in fstab=> cat/etc/fstab=> vi/etc/fstab=> lsblk -- fs / dev / vdb
8. Systemctl daemon-reload=> system etl daemon -reload 
9. Mount the partition on the directory=> mount/archieve=>  df-h
