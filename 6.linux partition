*Introduction :
- The process of dividing a disk into logical areas that can be worked with separately is called partitioning.
-For easy backup procedure,for many os on a single disk,for having different partition for different file systems ,more management of disk memory ,etc.
 for this  we use partitioning.

*Types of chips for motherboard:
1.BIOS:
-Master Boot Record (MBR) method is used which have MSDOS as labels for BIOS.
-Hardisk size 2 Tb & metadata stored from start to end partition.
-Can do only 4 primary partition for booting process files & extended can have 64 partition.
2.UFI:
-GUID Partition Table (GPT) method is used For UFI.
-Hardisk size 10 Tb .
-The storage is divided into two parts known as Primary Partition & Extended Partition.
-Primary partition has booting file & extended partion has storage files for the data to store.
-In GPT, it is possible to create primary & extended but after creating extended you can not create primary.
-Can do 64 partition & GPT have backend

*Two kinds of major partitions on a Linux system:
1.data partition: normal Linux system data, including the root partition containing all the data to start up and run the system; 
2.swap partition: expansion of the computer's physical memory, extra memory on hard disk.

* The MBR :
-The first sector is the master boot record (MBR) of the disk; this is the sector that the BIOS reads in and starts when the machine is first booted.
-The partitioning scheme is not built into the hardware, or even into the BIOS. 
-It is only a convention that many OS follow. Not all OS do follow it, but they are the exceptions. 
-Some OS support partitions, but they occupy one partition on the hard disk, and use their internal partitioning method within that partition. 
-The latter type exists peacefully with other operating systems (including Linux), and does not require any special measures, but an operating system that doesn't support partitions cannot co-exist on the same disk with any other operating system.

*Extended and logical partitions : 
-The original partitioning scheme for PC hard disks allowed only four partitions. 
-This quickly turned out to be too little in real life, partly because some people want more than four operating systems,
 but primarily because sometimes it is a good idea to have several partitions for one operating system. 
For example, swap space is usually best put in its own partition for Linux instead of in the main Linux partition for reasons of speed.
-This allows partitioning a primary partition into sub-partitions.
-The primary partition thus subdivided is the extended partition;
-The sub-partitions are logical partitions. They behave like primary partitions, but are created differently. There is no speed difference between them.

*Steps to create a partition :

1. List partitions=> Parted -l
2. Label a partition=> parted / dev /vdb mklabel msdos => parted -l 
3. Use mkpart to make a partition=> parted /dev /vdb => mkpart=> primary=> xfs=> 2048s=> x%=> p
4. Let the partition be created/settled=>quit first then=> Udevam settle
5. Attach the file system to the partition=> mkfs. xFs /dev/vdbl
6. Create a mount point directory=> df-h => mkdir / archive
7. Add entry in fstab=> cat/etc/fstab=> vi/etc/fstab=> lsblk -- fs / dev / vdb
8. Systemctl daemon-reload=> system etl daemon -reload 
9. Mount the partition on the directory=> mount/archieve=>  df-h
10. Reboot
